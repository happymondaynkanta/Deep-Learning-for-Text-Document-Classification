# Deep-Learning-for-Text-Document-Classification
Text classification is one of the popular tasks in NLP that allows a program to classify free-text documents based on pre-defined classes.
## Why Text-Document Classification?
Todayâ€™s emergence of large digital documents makes the text classification task more crucial, especially for companies to maximize their workflow or even profits.
Recently, the progress of NLP research on text classification has arrived at the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It has achieved terrific results, showing Deep Learning methods as the cutting-edge technology to perform such tasks.
Hence, the need to assess the performance of the SOTA deep learning models for text classification is essential not only for academic purposes but also for AI practitioners or professionals that need guidance and benchmark on similar projects.
